## Overview

Pavo Coin is on a mission to revolutionize decentralized finance by providing a transparent and secure platform for users worldwide. Recognizing the need for a Web3 powered ecosystem, we built a high performance decentralized application (dApp) that allows users to stake, trade, and manage their assets seamlessly.

To ensure maximum security and efficiency, we integrated smart contracts on the Solana blockchain, enabling fast and low-cost transactions. The platformâ€™s intuitive user interface ensures accessibility for both crypto newcomers and experienced traders.
